# The Realization of Social-Material-Truth in Free Association: A Proof of a Truly Free Association of Producers
Version 1.0.2

**Definitions:**
- Direct Mutual Contribution: A ↔ B (A and B directly contribute to each other)
- Transitive Mutual Contribution: A ↔ B ↔ C (A and B transitively contribute to each other via B)
- Social-Material-Coordination: D ↔ E (D and E socially-coordinate their social and or material-production)

**Let us finally imagine, for a change, a directly/transitively mutualistic free association of free individuals, coordinating their social and or material production without any centralized control or planning. Without the need for private-property or the state.**

Such coordination requires more than mere abstract agreement or forced cooperation - it demands real contribution to each other's self-actualization (contributions towards needs, values, goals, social and or material dependencies etc.). 

**In this free association, the share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-recognition of contribution towards their own self-actualization (self-actualization of the other)!**

In this proof, we demonstrate how social-material-truth is realized through free association: surplus flows according to mutual recognition of real contributions, relations activate only through genuine desire and participation, and these properties persist even as relations compose into complex social structures. Simple math reveals how in free association: false recognition/relations naturally decay while true recognition/relations strengthens - that recognition and social-relations organized on the basis of this free-association necessarily tend towards social-material-truth.

**Let:**
- Recognition = one's acknowledgment of contributions towards one's own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and or material dependencies etc.)

**For any participants A and B:**
1. A can (re)-attribute to B a share of A's total recognition of contribution towards A's self-actualization
2. B can (re)-attribute to A a share of B's total recognition of contribution towards B's self-actualization

**Let:**
- Mutual-Recognition(A, B) = min(B-share-of-A's-total-recognition,  A-share-of-B's-total-recognition) = Mutual-Contribution towards the self-actualization of each other (contributions towards each others needs, values, goals, social and or material dependencies etc.)

Associations are relations where:
1. Each relation consists of (Provider-Role, User-Role)
2. Each Role has a Holder who can:
   - Express Desire (Will to Play)
   - Express Playing (Active-Participation)
3. Relations become Active only when:
   - Both Role-Holders express Desire
   - Both Role-Holders express Playing
4. Relations can be composed into larger structures while maintaining these properties

**Let:**
- Surplus = Roles one holds but does not desire
- Surplus can be distributed directly/transitively via Mutual Recognition Distributions: **The share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-recognition of contribution towards their own self-actualization (self-actualization of the other)!**

"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"

The distribution of surplus-roles through networks of mutual-contribution is a form of distributed-peer-discovery/matching! Finding collaborators who directly/transitively contribute to your self-actualization!

**Let:**
- **Total Recognition = True Recognition + False Recognition**

**For any participant:**
- ∴ ↑False Recognition = ↓True Recognition
- ∴ ↓Mutual Recognition with Real Producers
- ∴ ↓Associations with Real Producers
- ∴ ↓Access to Real Social-Material Coordination via Associations with Real Producers

**For any Association between A and B:**
- Playing(A↔B) = Desire(A→B) ∧ Desire(B→A) ∧ Playing(A) ∧ Playing(B)

**Let:**
- Total Desire = True Desire + False Desire
- Total Playing = True Playing + False Playing

**Therefore:**
- ↑False Desire = ↓True Desire
- ↑False Playing = ↓True Playing

**Free Association requires:**
1. Mutual Recognition > 0
2. Mutual Desire (both parties genuinely desire the relation)
3. Mutual Playing (both parties actively participate)

- ∴ ↓True Recognition → ↓Mutual Recognition
- ∴ ↓True Desire → ↓Mutual Desire
- ∴ ↓True Playing → ↓Mutual Playing
- ∴ ↓Any of Above → ↓Free Association

**For any participant:**
- ↓Real Contributions → ↓Real Mutual Recognition
- ↓Real Mutual Recognition → ↓Real Mutual Desire
- ↓Real Mutual Desire → ↓Real Mutual Playing
- ↓Real Mutual Playing → ↓Free Association
- ↓Free Association → ↓Real Social-Material Coordination via Associations with Real Producers

"In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime desire; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!" (Marx)

# What is being done:
- Ruzgar: A p2p interface (a single html file) is being created for peers to express their mutual-recognition of contributions towards their own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and or material dependencies etc.) and to distribute associations (mutual-relations) according to their mutual-recognition-distributions. Implementing all the logic presented in this proof.  
**The interface is almost complete but I am seeking support to continue my efforts in the development of the interface (housing, food, financial support etc.).**
