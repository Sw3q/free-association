# Proof and Strategy for a Truly Free Association of Free Individuals

We present a formulation of a legitimate alternative to capitalism that allows for the *spontaneous self-actualization of all through each other* without any centralized control, planning, private-property or state intervention!

This requires more than mere abstract agreement or forced cooperation - it demands real contribution to each other's self-actualization (contributions towards needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.).

**In this free association, the share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-recognition of contribution towards their own self-actualization (self-actualization of the other)!**

**Surplus flows according to mutual-recognition of real contributions, relations activate only through genuine desire and participation, and these properties persist even as relations compose into complex social structures.**

Simple math will reveal how in free association: false recognition/relations naturally decay while true recognition/relations strengthens - that recognition and social-relations organized on the basis of this free association necessarily tend towards social-material-truth.

You can interact with an interface implementing this logic [here](https://interplaynetary.github.io/free-association/) (still in active development).

**Let:**
- **One's Recognition** = one's acknowledgment of contributions towards one's own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.)
- **One's Total-Recognition** = 100%

**For any participants A and B:**
1. A can (re)-attribute to B a share of A's total-recognition
2. B can (re)-attribute to A a share of B's total-recognition

**Let:**
- **Mutual-Recognition(A, B)** = min(B-share-of-A's-total-recognition,  A-share-of-B's-total-recognition) = Mutual-Contributions towards eachother's self-actualization

**For example:** If you are 50% of my total-recognition, and I am 10% of your total-recognition, our mutual-recognition is 10%, the minimum of the both.

*Taking the minimum of both shares ensures reciprocity in proportion* 

*Mutual-recognition is the peer-2-peer social-validation of eachother's efforts as well as the social-validation of use-values/utility."

*Interestingly  we don't have to keep a ledger of objects whose definitions are centrally defined, there is no universal definition of object-hood (of what constitutes objects), but a distributed recognition of the social-utility of contributions!*

*In free-association, one does not value apples (objects) but a contributor's provision of apples (subject-verb-object).*

**Let:**
- **Association** = a set of relations where:
1. Each Relation consists of (Provider-Role, User-Role)
2. Each Role has a Holder who can:
   - Express Desire (Will to Play)
   - Express Playing (Active-Participation)
3. Relations become Active only when:
   - Both Role-Holders express Desire
   - Both Role-Holders express Playing
4. Holders can stop expressing Desire and Playing at any time
5. Relations can be composed into larger structures while maintaining these properties

**Let:**
- **Surplus** = Roles one holds but does not desire
   - Surplus can be distributed directly/transitively via Mutual-Recognition Distributions: **The share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-recognition of contributions towards their own self-actualization (self-actualization of the other)!**

*"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"*

*The distribution of surplus-roles through networks of mutual-contribution is a form of distributed-peer-discovery/offering/matching! Finding collaborators who directly/transitively contribute to your self-actualization!*

**Let:**
- **Total Recognition = 100%**
- **Total Recognition = True Recognition + False Recognition**
- **Real Contributors** = Those that actually perform the operations necessary to *transform* social-material reality in concrete-particular ways.

**For any participant:**
- ∴ ↑False Recognition = ↓True Recognition
- ∴ ↓Mutual-Recognition with Real Contributors
- ∴ ↓Surplus-Associations from Real Contributors
- ∴ ↓Access to Real Social-Material Coordination via Surplus-Associations from Real Contributors
- ∴ ↓Real Social-Material Basis for Self-Actualization
- ∴ social-material-truth is realized through Free Association

Consider someone receiving money from a wealthy person:

**True Recognition Scenario:**
- You need $1000 for rent
- A wealthy person provides you $1000
- You recognize their contribution to your need for money (say 20% of your total recognition)
- This is true recognition because they actually contributed to that specific need

**False Recognition Scenario:**
- You hope to get more money by flattering them
- You claim they've contributed to:
  - Environmental protection (20% recognition)
  - Community wellbeing (20% recognition) 
  - Cultural development (20% recognition)
- But these were actually achieved by other contributors

**Mathematical Impact:**
- Your total recognition must sum to 100%
- By giving 60% false recognition to the wealthy person
- Plus 20% true recognition for money
- Only 20% remains for all real contributors
- Therefore:
  - Real environmental contributors can get max 20% recognition
  - Their mutual recognition with you decreases
  - Their surplus (help) flows less to you
  - Your actual needs get less fulfilled

**Key Insight:**
If you wanted more money legitimately, you could:
1. Honestly adjust your need distribution (e.g. "Money is 40% of my needs")
2. Give appropriate recognition for money received
3. Maintain recognition for other real contributors

This preserves your ability to receive genuine help for all needs while being truthful about what was really contributed.

The mathematics naturally punishes false recognition by reducing your access to real contributions. You can't get more total value by inflating recognition - you only decrease your connection to real contributors.

**For any Association between A and B:**
- Mutual-Desire(A↔B) = Desire(A→B) ∧ Desire(B→A) 
- Mutual-Playing(A↔B) = Mutual-Desire(A↔B) ∧ Playing(A→B) ∧ Playing(B→A)

**Free Association requires:**
1. Mutual-Recognition > 0
2. Mutual-Desire (both parties genuinely desire the relation)
3. Mutual-Playing (both parties actively participate)
4. Access to Social-Material Coordination Necessary for Mutual-Playing

**For any participant:**
- ↓Real Contributions → ↓Real Mutual-Recognition
- ↓Real Mutual-Recognition → ↓Real Mutual-Desire
- ↓Real Mutual-Desire → ↓Real Mutual-Playing
- ↓Real Mutual-Playing → ↓Free Association
- ↓Free Association → ↓Real Social-Material Coordination via Associations with Real Contributors

**On Capital Relations (and Coercive Relations in General) within Free Association:**

**Let:**
- Capitalist-Simulated-Production = Production appearing to come from capitalist but actually produced by contributors!
- Commodity Fetish = The masking of social-material relations of contribution behind the veil of the product as commodity (market-relations) - the objective social-forgetting of the social-origin of things
- Second-Order-False-Recognition = False recognition given to obtain capital for buying labor-power

**For any participant C attempting capital accumulation via Second-Order-False-Recognition:**
1. ↑Second-Order-False-Recognition of Capital → ↑ Possibility of Mutual-Recognition with Capital Provider
2. ↑Capital → ↑Ability to Buy Labor-Power
3. ↑Bought Labor-Power → ↑Capitalist-Simulated-Production
4. ↑Capitalist-Simulated-Production → ↑Real Products
5. ↑Real Products → ↑Potential for Real Recognition from Others

**However, for Real Contributors (A, B) whose labor-power has been bought by C:**
1. As A, B begin organizing on basis of Free Association:
   - ↑Recognition of mutual dependencies in contribution
   - ↑Recognition of potential direct association (A↔B)
   - ↑Pressure on C participate in contribution and make real-contributions
   - ↑Contradiction between:
     - C's need to maintain capitalist claim to ownership of surplus and means of contribution
     - C's need to have contributions recognized by freely associating contributors

2. This contradiction intensifies as:
   - ↑Labor-Power Purchased → ↑Potential for that Labor-Power to organize on the basis of Free Association
   - ↑Formation of Direct Contributor Associations
   - ↑Visibility of real contribution dependencies
   - ↓Effectiveness of commodity fetish in masking relations

**Therefore:**
- ↑Organization of bought labor-power via Free Association
- → ↑Internal pressure to reveal real internal contribution relations
- → ↓Internal recognition of Capitalist's claim surplus-contribution/distribution
- → ↑Recognition of direct contributor dependencies
- ∴ Capital relations become increasingly unstable as bought labor-power organizes via Free Association

**In other words:**
The commodity fetish cannot persist when the labor-power being purchased begins organizing on the basis of Free Association, as this creates pressure to reveal real contribution relations. The commodity fetish, which normally masks social relations of contribution, cannot be maintained within Free Association because Free Association requires demonstration of real contribution, creating a contradiction that must resolve either through the loss of recognition of Capitalist-Simulated-Production or its dissolution into Free Association.

**On Free Association and State Power:**

**Let:**
- State-Power = The organized force appearing separate from and above contributors
- State-Mediated Governance = Coordination via state apparatus rather than direct free association
- State-Simulated-Coordination = Coordination appearing to come from state but actually from contributor self-organization
- State Fetish = The masking of real social-coordination behind the veil of state authority - the objective social-forgetting of the self-organizing capacity of contributors
- Property Relations = Legal framework enforcing exclusive control over means of contribution
- Bourgoise Legal Fetish = The masking of class relations behind formal equality before the law

**For any state apparatus S attempting to maintain property relations:**
1. Initial state:
   - State power maintains property relations
   - Property relations restrict common utilization despite dissolution of particular capitalist organization
   - Coordination appears as coming from above
   - Social relations appear as legal relations

2. However, as free association expands:
   - ↑Scale of free association
   - ↑Number of contributors organizing via free association
   - ↑Practical common utilization despite formal property relations
   - ↑Contradiction between:
     - Legal property framework
     - Actual contribution relations

3. This contradiction intensifies as:
   - ↑Gap between formal ownership and real utilization
   - ↑Material power of associated contributors
   - ↑Self-Coordination of Contributors → ↓Need for State-Mediated-Governance
   - ↑Difficulty of enforcing private-property relations

**Therefore:**
- ↑Organization via Free Association
- → ↑Visibility of real coordination capabilities
- → ↓Recognition of state's claim to necessary coordination role
- → ↑Recognition of contributor self-organization capacity
- ∴ State power becomes increasingly superfluous as contributors organize via Free Association

**In other words:**
The state fetish cannot persist when contributors organize via Free Association, as this demonstrates their real capacity for self-coordination. State power, which normally appears as necessary external force, reveals itself as superfluous when Free Association shows contributors' capacity to coordinate their own social-material contribution.

**Therefore:**
- ∴ State power isn't abolished but withers away as its functions are increasingly rendered unnecessary in Free Association
- ∴ The social-coordination of things replaces the government of persons
- ∴ Free Association realizes both social and material self-governance of contributors

**Therefore**
- ∴ (↑Dissolution of capitalist organization into Free Association ∧ ↓Effectiveness of state power in maintaining private-property relations) → ↓Force of the limits imposed by organizational-forms-based-on-class-division on the utilization of means of contribution in common by Freely Associating Contributors
- ∴ ↑Means of contribution in common → ↑Access to Materials Necessary for Playing Associations
- ∴ ↑Truly Free Association (both socially and materially)

**Definitions:**
- Direct Mutual Contribution: A ↔ B (A and B directly contribute to each other)
- Transitive Mutual Contribution: A ↔ B ↔ C (A and B transitively contribute to each other via B)

**Let us imagine, for a change, a directly/transitively mutualistic truly free association of free individuals, spontaneously coordinating their social-material contribution with the means of contribution in common, without any centralized control or planning. Without the need for private-property or the state.**

*"In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime desire; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"* (Marx)

***Freedom* and *necessity* are not opposed but united in the free association of contributors.**

**When individuals freely contribute to each other's self-actualization, when surplus flows according to mutual-recognition of real contributions, when relations activate only through genuine desire and participation - then we have finally a form in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all!**

*"Communism as the positive transcendence of private property as human self-estrangement, and therefore as the real appropriation of the human essence by and for man; communism therefore as the complete return of man to himself as a social (i.e., human) being – a return accomplished consciously and embracing the entire wealth of previous development. This communism, as fully developed naturalism, equals humanism, and as fully developed humanism equals naturalism; it is the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man – the true resolution of the strife between existence and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation, between freedom and necessity, between the individual and the species. Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution."* (Marx)

*"Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life, which corresponds to the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting-off of all natural limitations."* (Marx)

# What is being done:
- Ruzgar: A p2p interface (a single html file) is being created for peers to express their mutual-recognition of contributions towards their own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and/or material dependencies etc.) and to distribute associations (mutual-relations) according to their mutual-recognition-distributions. Implementing all the logic presented in this proof. 

It is being developed open-source at [interplaynetary-github](https://github.com/interplaynetary/free association) but is additionally available p2p on [radicl](https://link-needed).

**A basic interface for free association is almost complete but we are seeking support in user-interface-development as well as support in the form of housing, food etc.**
