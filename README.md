# The Realization of Social-Material-Truth in Free Association: A Proof of a Truly Free Association of Producers
Version 1.0.3

**Definitions:**
- Direct Mutual Contribution: A ↔ B (A and B directly contribute to each other)
- Transitive Mutual Contribution: A ↔ B ↔ C (A and B transitively contribute to each other via B)
- Social-Material-Coordination: D ↔ E (D and E socially-coordinate their social and or material-production)

**Let us finally imagine, for a change, a directly/transitively mutualistic free-association of free individuals, coordinating their social and or material production without any centralized control or planning. Without the need for private-property or the state.**

Such coordination requires more than mere abstract agreement or forced cooperation - it demands real contribution to each other's self-actualization (contributions towards needs, values, goals, social and or material dependencies etc.). 

**In this free-association, the share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-recognition of contribution towards their own self-actualization (self-actualization of the other)!**

In this proof, we demonstrate how social-material-truth is realized through free-association: surplus flows according to mutual recognition of real contributions, relations activate only through genuine desire and participation, and these properties persist even as relations compose into complex social structures. Simple math reveals how in free-association: false recognition/relations naturally decay while true recognition/relations strengthens - that recognition and social-relations organized on the basis of this free-association necessarily tend towards social-material-truth.

**Let:**
- Recognition = one's acknowledgment of contributions towards one's own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and or material dependencies etc.)

**For any participants A and B:**
1. A can (re)-attribute to B a share of A's total recognition of contribution towards A's self-actualization
2. B can (re)-attribute to A a share of B's total recognition of contribution towards B's self-actualization

**Let:**
- Mutual-Recognition(A, B) = min(B-share-of-A's-total-recognition,  A-share-of-B's-total-recognition) = Mutual-Contribution towards the self-actualization of each other (contributions towards each others needs, values, goals, social and or material dependencies etc.)

Associations are relations where:
1. Each relation consists of (Provider-Role, User-Role)
2. Each Role has a Holder who can:
   - Express Desire (Will to Play)
   - Express Playing (Active-Participation)
3. Relations become Active only when:
   - Both Role-Holders express Desire
   - Both Role-Holders express Playing
4. Relations can be composed into larger structures while maintaining these properties

**Let:**
- Surplus = Roles one holds but does not desire
- Surplus can be distributed directly/transitively via Mutual Recognition Distributions: **The share of each individual in the surplus-distribution of others is equal to their share of the other's total mutual-recognition of contribution towards their own self-actualization (self-actualization of the other)!**

"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"

The distribution of surplus-roles through networks of mutual-contribution is a form of distributed-peer-discovery/matching! Finding collaborators who directly/transitively contribute to your self-actualization!

**Let:**
- **Total Recognition = True Recognition + False Recognition**

**For any participant:**
- ∴ ↑False Recognition = ↓True Recognition
- ∴ ↓Mutual Recognition with Real Producers
- ∴ ↓Associations with Real Producers
- ∴ ↓Access to Real Social-Material Coordination via Associations with Real Producers

**For any Association between A and B:**
- Playing(A↔B) = Desire(A→B) ∧ Desire(B→A) ∧ Playing(A) ∧ Playing(B)

**Let:**
- Total Desire = True Desire + False Desire
- Total Playing = True Playing + False Playing

**Therefore:**
- ↑False Desire = ↓True Desire
- ↑False Playing = ↓True Playing

**Free Association requires:**
1. Mutual Recognition > 0
2. Mutual Desire (both parties genuinely desire the relation)
3. Mutual Playing (both parties actively participate)

- ∴ ↓True Recognition → ↓Mutual Recognition
- ∴ ↓True Desire → ↓Mutual Desire
- ∴ ↓True Playing → ↓Mutual Playing
- ∴ ↓Any of Above → ↓Free Association

**For any participant:**
- ↓Real Contributions → ↓Real Mutual Recognition
- ↓Real Mutual Recognition → ↓Real Mutual Desire
- ↓Real Mutual Desire → ↓Real Mutual Playing
- ↓Real Mutual Playing → ↓Free Association
- ↓Free Association → ↓Real Social-Material Coordination via Associations with Real Producers

**On Capital Relations (and Power Relations in General) within Free Association:**

**Let:**
- Capital-Mediated Production = Production coordinated via buying labor rather than direct free-association
- Capital-Simulated-Production = Production appearing to come from capitalist but actually from bought labor
- Commodity Fetish = The masking of social-material relations of production behind the veil of the product as commodity (market-relations) - the objective social-forgetting of the social-origin of things.
- Second-Order-False-Recognition = False recognition given to obtain capital for buying labor

**For any participant C attempting capital accumulation via Second-Order-False-Recognition:**
1. ↑Second-Order-False-Recognition of Capital → ↑ Possibility of Mutual-Recognition with Capital Provider
2. ↑Capital → ↑Ability to Buy Labor
3. ↑Bought Labor → ↑Capital-Simulated-Production
4. ↑Capital-Simulated-Production → ↑Real Products
5. ↑Real Products → ↑Potential for Real Recognition from Others

**However, for Real Producers (A, B) bought by C:**
1. Initial state maintains commodity fetish:
   - Products appear as independent of producers
   - Social relations appear as relations between things
   - Real production relations remain hidden

2. As A, B begin organizing on basis of free-association:
   - ↑Recognition of mutual dependencies in production
   - ↑Recognition of potential direct association (A↔B)
   - ↑Pressure on C to explain their contribution
   - ↑Contradiction between:
     - Need to maintain commodity fetish
     - Need to justify role to freely associating producers

3. This contradiction intensifies as:
   - ↑Labour Purchased → ↑Potential for that Labour to organize on the basis of free-association
   - ↑Formation of direct producer associations
   - ↑Visibility of real production dependencies
   - ↓Effectiveness of commodity fetish in masking relations

**Therefore:**
- ↑Organization of bought labor via free-association
- → ↑Internal pressure to reveal real internal production relations
- → ↓Internal recognition of Capitalist's claim surplus-production/distribution
- → ↑Recognition of direct producer dependencies
- ∴ Capital relations become increasingly unstable as bought labor organizes via free-association

**In other words:**
The commodity fetish cannot persist when the labor power being purchased begins organizing on the basis of free-association, as this creates pressure to reveal real production relations. The commodity fetish, which normally masks social relations of production, cannot be maintained within free-association because free-association requires demonstration of real contribution, creating a contradiction that must resolve either through the loss of recognition of Capitalist-Simulated-Production or its dissolution into Free-Association.

∴ ↑Dissolution of capitalist organization into free-association → ↓Force of the limits imposed by capitalist organizational-forms on the utilization of means of production in common by the free-association of producers
∴ ↑Means of production in common

"In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime desire; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!" (Marx)

# What is being done:
- Ruzgar: A p2p interface (a single html file) is being created for peers to express their mutual-recognition of contributions towards their own self-actualization (contributions towards one's needs, values, goals, social and or material dependencies etc.) and to distribute associations (mutual-relations) according to their mutual-recognition-distributions. Implementing all the logic presented in this proof. It is available at [interplaynetary-github](https://github.com/interplaynetary/free-association) but is additionally available p2p on [radicl](https://link-needed).
**A basic interface for free-association is almost complete but I am seeking support (housing, food, financial support etc.) to continue its development.**

# Revolutionary Strategy for Free Association

**Phase 1: Building the Infrastructure of Free Association**
- Develop and test the p2p interface for mutual recognition
- Create documentation in multiple languages
- Build tools for tracking real contributions and dependencies
- Establish initial communities of practice
- Focus on making tools accessible and easy to use

**Phase 2: Practical Implementation & Documentation**
- Start with small-scale experiments in existing projects
- Document real experiences meticulously
- Identify and solve practical challenges
- Create educational materials based on real experiences
- Build network of mutual support between implementations

**Phase 3: Expanding Producer Networks**
- Connect different communities using free association
- Help producers recognize their mutual dependencies
- Support transition from capital relations to direct association
- Document and share successful transitions
- Build infrastructure for larger-scale coordination

**Phase 4: Strategic Acceleration**
1. Within Capital-Mediated Production:
   - Help workers recognize mutual dependencies
   - Support organization on basis of free association
   - Document how commodity fetish breaks down
   - Build tools for direct producer coordination

2. Within Free Association Networks:
   - Strengthen direct producer relationships
   - Develop surplus sharing mechanisms
   - Create tools for complex coordination
   - Support material needs of contributors

3. Expanding Common Means of Production:
   - ↑Dissolution of capitalist organization into free association
   - → ↓Force of capitalist limits on common production
   - → ↑Means of production in common
   - → ↑Capacity for free association
   - → ↑Further dissolution of capitalist organization

**Key Strategic Principles:**
1. Theory guides practice, practice develops theory
2. Start small but build for scale
3. Document everything, share widely
4. Focus on real material relationships
5. Support both immediate needs and long-term transformation
