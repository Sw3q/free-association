# Free Association - React Native Conversion Progress

## Completed Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup ✅
- Initialized a new React Native project using Expo (FreeAssociationApp)
- Set up the appropriate folder structure for React Native
- Configured necessary dependencies including:
  - react-native-svg for SVG rendering
  - victory-native for charts
  - d3 for data processing
  - React Navigation for screen management

### Step 2: Core Data Models ✅
- Converted JavaScript class-based models to TypeScript:
  - Node.js → Node.ts
  - Associations.js → Associations.ts
- Maintained the same functionality while adapting to React Native
- Added proper TypeScript type definitions

### Step 3: State Management ✅
- Implemented React Context (NodeContext) for global state management
- Created custom hooks (useNodeData) for accessing node data and relationships
- Used React hooks for efficient component-level state management

### Step 4: UI Components (Partial) ✅
- Created HomeScreen as the main UI component
- Implemented modals for adding new nodes
- Created responsive layouts for mobile devices
- Set up basic navigation structure

### Step 5: Visualizations ✅
- Replaced D3.js DOM manipulations with React Native SVG components
- Implemented TreeMap visualization in React Native
- Implemented PieChart visualization in React Native

### Step 7: Testing (Partial) ✅
- Set up Jest and React Native Testing Library
- Created basic unit tests for the Node model
- Created component tests for HomeScreen
- Configured code coverage tracking

## Next Steps

### Complete Step 4: UI Components
- Add more screens for managing associations and peers
- Enhance UI with animations and transitions

### Step 6: Peer-to-Peer Functionality
- Research and integrate peer-to-peer libraries for React Native
- Implement secure peer discovery and communication
- Enable sharing of nodes and recognition data between users

### Complete Step 7: Testing and Refinement
- Add more comprehensive tests for all components
- Test on various devices and screen sizes
- Optimize performance for mobile devices

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **TreeMap Performance**: The current implementation may have performance issues with large data sets
2. **P2P Connectivity**: Peer-to-peer functionality not yet implemented
3. **Data Persistence**: Currently lacks local storage implementation
4. **UI Responsiveness**: Some UI elements may not scale well on all device sizes

## Development Notes

- The TreeMap visualization needed significant refactoring from D3's DOM manipulation approach to React Native's declarative SVG components
- React Native's SVG implementation has limitations compared to web SVG, requiring workarounds for certain animations
- PeerJS is not directly compatible with React Native, requiring alternative solutions for P2P functionality
- Consider using WebRTC-compatible libraries or Firebase as alternatives for P2P connectivity
- Implemented a minimal React Context for state management rather than Redux to reduce boilerplate code
- Focused on code minimalism to reduce potential liability and improve maintainability 
- Unit testing configuration is in place, allowing early debugging as features are implemented
