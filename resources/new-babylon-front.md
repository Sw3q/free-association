# New Babylon: The Free Association Front

**IMPULSE/VECTOR:**

Modular
Composable
Interoperable
Architectures for social-play

Creating a fluid architecture of social relations - not fixed structures, but dynamic spaces where people can freely play and transform their environment and relationships! Free play of body and mind!

**QUESTIONS:**
- How do we build spaces for spontaneous play?
- How do we enable people to modify their social-physical architecture?
- How do we connect different zones of free activity?
- How do we make the means of creation available to all?

Production Process requiring stability and robustness, stable operations within the planet, underground
Necessary distribution across of the playnet
Bridges and interactions

**MOVES:**

**1. Spatial Recognition Moves:**
- **Recognize-Contribution** → Like identifying who helped create a space you love
- **Adjust-Recognition** → Modifying your map of contributors as spaces evolve
- **Share-Recognition-Story** → Document how others transformed your environment
- **Track-Dependencies** → Map the network of mutual support

**2. Architectural Role Moves:**
- **Express-Desire-to-Play** → "I want to help build this sector!"
- **Express-Playing** → Actually participating in construction/transformation
- **Propose-New-Role** → Creating new ways to modify the environment
- **Transform-Role** → Changing how you contribute to the space

**3. Sector Relation Moves:**
- **Initiate-Relation** → Start a new zone of collaborative creation
- **Activate-Relation** → Both parties actively transforming space together
- **Compose-Relations** → Connect different sectors into larger networks
- **Transform-Relation** → Change how sectors interact

**4. Resource Distribution Moves:**
- **Identify-Surplus** → Share unused tools and materials
- **Distribute-Surplus** → Route resources to where they're needed
- **Request-Surplus** → Ask for tools/materials you could use
- **Coordinate-Surplus** → Help match resources to projects

**5. Infrastructure Moves:**
- **Share-Tools** → Make construction tools available
- **Offer-Skills** → Teach others how to modify spaces
- **Document-Methods** → Record successful transformations
- **Build-Connections** → Create links between sectors

Think of it like New Babylon: We're not building a fixed city, but creating tools and connections that let everyone become architects of their social space! Each person can:
- Recognize who contributes to their environment
- Express desire to help build/transform spaces
- Form direct relations with other creators
- Share surplus tools and materials
- Connect different zones of free activity

The whole structure grows organically through real collaboration, like Constant's sectors linking into an endless network of transformed spaces!


There is no limit to size of new babylon because in 

means of movement and transformation change as we extend beyond the playnets surface towards all of Space! (including our solar system etc.)
