# Readme
[] - Add intro on how this economy is based on gratitude! Recognize, feel, and act!
[] - Add examples
 
# Treemap
[✅] - make text scale to fit
[✅] - descriptions on nodes
[✅] - make contributor instances last node (can't go further down in tree)
[✅] - Make calculations more efficient? using contributor-map?
[✅] - It should be clearly possible to make a node a contributor simply if it doesnt have a parent!
[] - Lets simplify isContributor logic!
[] - Lets simplify getShareOfGeneralContribution logic! And generalize to traversal of any note, default is general.
[] - Allow for distributing surplus to any branch

# Node
[] - Are we properly accounting for the share of an instance in a node? (especially when it has multiple types which are contributors) (split the share of that instance between the types)?
[] - Make type-circles on nodes transition more smoothly

# P2P
refer to [docs/p2p.md](docs/p2p.md)

# Inventory & Associations
[] - add a button to distribute surplus (in general, or to a specific branch/leaf?)
[] - integrate with inventory.html
[] - make inventory.html more user-friendly


# Interface
[] - + Node button (big) (Import sub-treefrom Library)
[] - - Node button (big) (Drop sub-tree into Library)

[] - Make everything more smooth, with less sharp clicks!

[] - Allow for touching multiple nodes at once
[] - Allow for dragging nodes around
[] - Allow for composing nodes (dragging nodes to other nodes)
[] - Allow for changing speed of growth
[] - Allow for changing speed of growth
[] - Menubuttons instead of text for add value
[] - Distribute surplus to any branch
[] - AI Integration!
[] - allow for choosing your own name!
[] - Allow adding multiple types/contributors to nodes
[] - How to unallocate points? (when points = 0, remove node)
[] - How to manually reorder them? (by dragging?)
[] - How do we show mutuality directly in the structure? (Showing max min and overlap? Of colors? Of self and other?)
[] - Add a new intermediary class? For networking / persistence?
[] - Add description to Nodes (and maybe other things?)
[] - node.makeContributor (retroactively) turns type into contributor
[] - Display Descriptions to Nodes if they exist! 
[] - Make contributor have special outline
[] - "Add Contributor" button should reveal tabs: known (including self), add new contributor (reveal QR of self to others)
[] - clicking contributor makes it the new root?
    (so you can see the tree from their perspective)
    (but your perspective is retained (your perspective of their perspective))
